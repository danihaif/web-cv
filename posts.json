I have zero knowledge in web development, but decided to reach out to my LLM buddy (for which I pay $20 a month, thank you very much 😂) for help. This resulted in a very interesting day 🌟. What I have come to realize is that the AI revolution 🤖 will be a major force in lowering the barrier of entry for many fields. Of course, this website is really simplistic and does not contain sophisticated logic (it doesn't even have a backend and is hosted on GitHub Pages, which allow static content only 📄), but it gets the job done ✅. OK, enough typing; I am getting tired 😴. I am off prompting my LLMB (B is for buddy) with my original text so it will correct all my typos and spelling mistakes. You know what, I'll ask him to add emojis too 🎉. Let's make it more fun 🥳 and see if he can sprinkle a little magic ✨ on my humble text.",
