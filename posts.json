We started by discussing the creation of a beautiful, public CV website, followed by the decision on a domain name and the intricacies of hosting it. Transitioning the site to a React-based architecture for a more professional deployment was also covered. Furthermore, we addressed potential npm and Node.js installation issues, ensuring a smooth development process. Adding dynamic elements such as animations on click events and summarizing extensive professional experiences into a concise and engaging homepage narrative were key milestones. Lastly, the expansion of the site with a new blog section signifies a new chapter where my thoughts and experiences can be shared broadly."
